# OBI HOWL Demo

This repository contains a human-readable version of the [Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](http://obi-ontology.org) using [HOWL format](http://humaneowl.com). The source data for OBI is stored in human-readable HOWL format, then automatically translated into an `obi.owl` file in the standard OWL/XML format. We aim to demonstrate that HOWL is suitable for use with a complex ontology, and that human-readable formats provide many advantages over current workflows using OWL/XML files.

**NOTE:** This is work-in-progress using the development version of HOWL. While our goal is lossless translation from to and from HOWL format, we have not yet achieved our goal: not all files can be fully translated with the current development release of HOWL, and some information is lost in translation.
